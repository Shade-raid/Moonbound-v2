# Moonbound: The Ashen Crown Chronicles

A deep, atmospheric dark fantasy visual novel created for [SuNoFes 2025](https://itch.io/jam/sunofes25) - a game jam focused on visual novels and story-based games.

**Made by Shade**

## About the Game

**Moonbound: The Ashen Crown Chronicles** is an extensive dark fantasy visual novel that explores themes of eternal recurrence, moral complexity, and the weight of choices across infinite timelines. Set in 13th century Eastern Europe, you play as the Chronicler - an immortal observer who must choose a champion to stand against the cursed Ashen Crown.

### Story Overview

In the twilight of the 13th century, the mystical Ashen Crown has shattered the very fabric of time itself. As the Chronicler, you witness infinite cycles of heroes rising to challenge the curse, only to fall and be reborn again. Each Requiem resets the world, but the bonds you forge with your champions transcend death itself.

The Crown's malevolent power grows stronger with each passing cycle. Its influence spreads like a shadow across the land, corrupting everything it touches. If it is not stopped now, the very fabric of reality may unravel completely.

The game features five unique champions, each with their own tragic backstory, extensive character development, and multiple deep story routes:
